How We Did It:

First we laid the groundwork with some variables and event listeners.

Then we added a function to generate a randomized cover on the homepage upon initial and subsequent reloadings.

After that, we instantiated an instance of our main class and added some more variables corresponding to the covers.

At this point we decided to branch out into other branches, creating a WIP/experimental branch for us to preserve versions of not-quite-working-yet code. Later in the project, upon receiving some feedback, we stopped using this branch and kept things in branches relevant to the feature we were building.

We added some buttons, event listeners and variables to finish out Iteration 0 and added more of them to start Iteration 1.

We added some more variables related to user input, then began work on the Make Cover function, adding event listeners as needed.

After that, we built a function for pushing saved covers to the relevant array and gave it an event listener to match.

We then added a function for saving user-generated covers. The HTML code block was quite the challenge to wrangle, but we took it down and finished out Iteration 3.

For the final iteration, we added two functions, one for finding the saved cover the user had double clicked to remove, and another to handle the removal.

We reformatted everything, cleaned up some redundancies, broke a button (and, thankfully, caught it in final review).

Final Thoughts:

Emma:

When I started this project, I was still shaky on many of its core concepts. Objects, arrays, event listeners, query selectors, HTML and CSS in general, the GitHub workflow (special thanks to Anthony Shellman: Git Wizard); all became magnitudes clearer after digging through countless MDN documentations and breaking things until they were fixed. I had the foresight to schedule weekend meetings with my mentor and rock a day in advance for times I suspected we might be stuck on one issue for a more-than-productive amount of time (e.g. if our group agreed to start on an iteration at 10am, I’d schedule the mentor meeting a few hours after that) which always proved incredibly helpful for getting us the hints we needed to start moving again. We also helped and were helped by many of our cohort mates, giving us several opportunities to both explain and learn concepts. I’m glad this project has been wrapped up, but the .gif cover image compatibility made it all worth it.   


Anthony:

This project was both challenging and rewarding. In the beginning, I didn't even know where to start. However, with the assistance of my awesome groupmate, Emma, we were able to start mapping out ideas of what we wanted to tackle first. Through building initial functions via pseudocoding, we were able to swap out ideas for actual, functioning code. When we eventually got stuck on various concepts, functions that didn’t quite work the way we wanted, or just needed to be pointed in the right direction, we headed to Study Hall for guidance. Our cohort was very helpful in getting us on the right track, providing feedback and giving moral support when needed. Emma was quite instrumental in asking for assistance from her rock and mentor as well; it was a privilege learning from/with everyone.

I now feel a bit more comfortable with various topics that we have learned about so far, and look forward to applying what I have learned in future projects.
